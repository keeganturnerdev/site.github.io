    title: About StackForm
    text: >
      Hi, I am Keegan, Creator of StackForm.
      StackForm is a concept, an idea of deploying a stack of technologies on a platform. This platform could be on your local machine, physical servers or in the cloud.
      My function involves constructing the foundational platform by deploying the essential programs and services to host your application in the cloud.
      StackForm is focused on deploying LAMP stacks in the cloud with the aim of bridging the gap between shared and dedicated solutions.
