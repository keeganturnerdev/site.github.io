As a Cloud Applications Platform Administrator, I specialize in constructing and deploying foundational platforms and applications using free open source software to establish the base layer for user websites. However, it is important to note that my role is limited to the setup and management of the underlying infrastructure and applications.

### Responsibilities:
- **Platform Construction:** I build the foundational infrastructure and deploy the necessary applications to create a reliable hosting platform for user websites.
- **Technical Setup:** I ensure that the cloud-based infrastructure is properly configured and optimized for performance and security.
- **Open Source Software Usage:** I utilize free open source software to develop and maintain the underlying platform, adhering to relevant licenses and guidelines.

### Limitations:
- **Performance and Changes:** While I strive to create a robust hosting environment, I am not responsible for the performance or functionality of individual websites hosted on the platform.
- **Software Updates:** Any changes made by the developers of the open source software used in the platform are beyond my control. I do not assume responsibility for any updates or modifications that may affect the functionality of the hosted websites.

### Web Development Responsibility:
- **Content Optimization:** It is the responsibility of the website owner or their designated web developer to ensure that the website content is well optimized for the hosting platform.
- **Maintenance and Updates:** Website owners are responsible for maintaining and updating their website content and applications to ensure compatibility with the hosting environment.

### Additional Provisions:
- **Indemnification:** Clients agree to indemnify and hold me harmless from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from their use of the hosting platform or any actions taken by their website visitors.
- **Data Loss Disclaimer:** I am not liable for any data loss or corruption that may occur due to factors beyond my control, such as hardware failures or cyber attacks.
- **Service Interruptions:** I am not responsible for any service interruptions or downtime, including those caused by maintenance, upgrades, or unforeseen technical issues.
- **Third-Party Services:** If third-party services or applications are integrated into the hosting platform, I am not responsible for their performance, availability, or security.

### Scope of Services:
As a freelancer, I am dedicated to providing quality service and flexibility to accommodate your needs. I am available to undertake projects and support requests outside of standard office hours SAST, ensuring accessibility and convenience for clients across various time zones.
- **Initial Consultation:** Your journey with cloud begins with a complimentary initial consultation lasting up to 30 minutes. This session allows us to delve into your objectives, address any inquiries or uncertainties, and ensure alignment with your vision.
- **Deposit Requirement:** Upon acceptance of the terms and conditions outlined in this agreement and confirmation of your selected product or service via email, a 50% deposit will be required to kickstart the deployment process for your cloud server instance/s. Once the deposit funds clear in my account and coincide with my shared availability as detailed in the Scope of Services, the deployment initiation will commence.

### Cancellation Policy:
- **Cancellation During Deployment Process:** In the event of cancellation during the deployment process of your cloud server instance/s, the 50% deposit will be deemed non-refundable. This fee accounts for the time and resources dedicated to provisioning your cloud server instance/s, resources that could have been directed toward other clients' deployments.
